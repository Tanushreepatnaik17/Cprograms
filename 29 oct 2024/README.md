# cprogram logic and code explanation
This code contains the program that replaces the value with o and 1
**objective**:To replace the value with 0 and 1
**logic**:
basically if the value of no is 3001 then it will be replaced with 3110
so we took three variables no ,modified and place=1
to check each digit we took a while loop
we used if statement inside while to know if the value is 0 then place will be modified to 1*place
if the value is 1 then place will be modified to 0*place else modified no is digit*place then it checks for all the digit same
after that it gives modified value..
